## First Steps

Admittedly, before taking an actual course on it, I had no idea what software engineering actually entailed. “Isn’t that just regular programming?” I had thought. How mistaken I was, then, to learn that there’s so much more to learn about this field than I had originally thought.

Software engineering has quite the history for itself. Several different programs for software engineering have seen use over the past decades, each with their own specialties and tricks to learn. I’m excited to learn more about our current system, GitHub. It’s already impressive that it can create websites like this — I’d like to see what else it’s capable of.

## Looking Forward

In the future, I hope to gain skills that allow me to work better under pressure. I can imagine with software engineering that you’re under a certain amount of pressure to create a program before a deadline. I also would like to program in a more efficient way; that is, for example, creating helper functions that can be re-used throughout the program rather than copy pasting code each time.
